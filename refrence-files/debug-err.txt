Root Cause:
Your server-side checkout endpoint is failing silently and returning {} instead of a proper error message. This usually means:

Database operation failed but error wasn't caught properly
Validation failed but no error details were returned
Server crashed but error handler returned empty object

How to Debug This:
Step 1: Check Your Server Logs
Look at your terminal/console where your server is running (port 3005). You should see error messages there.
Step 2: Add Debugging to Your Frontend
Add this to your handleSubmit function around line 197:
javascriptasync function handleSubmit(orderData) {
    try {
        console.log('Sending order:', orderData); // Debug: what are we sending?
        
        const response = await fetch('/api/checkout', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(orderData)
        });
        
        console.log('Response status:', response.status); // Debug: HTTP status
        console.log('Response ok:', response.ok); // Debug: was it successful?
        
        const result = await response.json();
        console.log('Server response:', result); // Debug: what did server send?
        
        if (!response.ok || !result || Object.keys(result).length === 0) {
            throw new Error(`Server error: ${response.status}`);
        }
        
        return result;
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Checkout error response:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
Step 3: Check Your Backend Checkout Endpoint
Your server-side code probably looks something like this and is failing:
javascriptapp.post('/api/checkout', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Your database save code here
        // If this fails, you're returning {} instead of an error
        res.json({ success: true, orderId: 123 });
    } catch (error) {
        // This is probably returning {} instead of proper error
        console.error('Checkout error:', error); // Check server logs!
        res.status(500).json({ 
            error: 'Checkout failed', 
            details: error.message 
        });
    }
});
Most Likely Issues:

Database connection failed - Check if your database is running
Table doesn't exist - Your orders or menu_items table might be missing
Validation schema mismatch - As we discussed earlier, pizza vs unified structure
Missing required fields - Database expecting fields you're not sending

Quick Test:
Open browser Developer Tools → Network tab → try to place an order → look for the /api/checkout request. Check:

What HTTP status code? (200, 400, 500?)
What's in the Response tab?
What's in the Request payload?

The {} response means your server is running but something is failing silently. The real error details are probably in your server console logs!
Can you check your server terminal/logs and see what error messages appear when you try to place an order?
