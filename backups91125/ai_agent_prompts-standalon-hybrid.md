## Modified AI Agent Context:

**Add this to your PRD:**
> **Future Vision: Multi-Client SaaS Platform**
> 
> While initially built for a single pizza restaurant, architect the application to easily support multiple restaurant clients in the future. Consider:
> - Configurable branding and theming
> - Scalable database design
> - API-first architecture for integrations
> - Admin tools for managing multiple locations

This approach lets you:
1. **Prove the concept** with your pizza place
2. **Generate revenue** from other restaurants 
3. **Build equity** in a scalable business
4. **Eventually integrate** with your main systems when ready

**Smart move!** You're building both a solution for your restaurant AND a potential software business. Want me to update the PRD to reflect this multi-client vision?
