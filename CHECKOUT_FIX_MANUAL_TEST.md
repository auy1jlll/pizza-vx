🧪 MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST FOR CHECKOUT FIX

The checkout system has been updated to use real database IDs instead of hardcoded fallback values.
Here's what to test:

📍 URL: http://localhost:3001/pizza-builder

🔍 TEST STEPS:

1. BUILD A PIZZA:
   ✅ Select any size (Small, Medium, Large)
   ✅ Select any crust (Traditional, Thin, etc.)
   ✅ Select any sauce (Tomato, BBQ, etc.)
   ✅ Add some toppings (Pepperoni, Mushrooms, etc.)
   ✅ Click "Add to Cart"

2. OPEN CHECKOUT:
   ✅ Click on cart icon or "Checkout" button
   ✅ CheckoutModal should open
   ✅ Pizza data should load automatically (check console for "✅ Pizza data loaded")

3. FILL CUSTOMER INFO:
   ✅ Name: Test Customer
   ✅ Email: test@example.com
   ✅ Phone: 555-0123
   ✅ Order Type: Delivery
   ✅ Address: 123 Test St
   ✅ City: Test City
   ✅ ZIP: 12345

4. SUBMIT ORDER:
   ✅ Click "Place Order" button
   ✅ Should see success message (not server crash)
   ✅ Order should be processed successfully

🐛 PREVIOUS BUG:
- Before fix: Server crashed with "Foreign key constraint failed"
- After fix: Orders process successfully with real database IDs

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
- CheckoutModal now loads pizza data from /api/pizza-data
- Items are transformed using real database IDs instead of fake ones
- Size, crust, sauce, and toppings use actual database IDs
- All schema validation passes because data is properly structured

⚠️ CONSOLE LOGS TO WATCH FOR:
✅ "Pizza data loaded for checkout validation"
✅ "Item transformed with real IDs"
✅ Order submission success (200 status)

❌ If you see these errors, something is still wrong:
❌ "Pizza data not loaded"
❌ "Missing required pizza components"
❌ "Foreign key constraint failed"
❌ Server crashes or 500 errors

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
The checkout process should complete without server crashes and create valid orders in the database.
