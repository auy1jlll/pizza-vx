# Dynamic Pricing System for Specialty Pizza Customization

## Overview
Implemented a sophisticated dynamic pricing system that provides accurate pricing adjustments for specialty pizza customizations, including credits for removed toppings and charges for additions and intensity modifications.

## Pricing Logic

### 1. Base Pricing
- **Specialty Pizzas**: Use the specialty pizza's base price (includes all original toppings)
- **Custom Pizzas**: Use the selected size's base price + individual topping charges

### 2. Intensity Multipliers
All toppings have intensity-based pricing:
- **Light**: 0.75x base topping price (25% discount)
- **Regular**: 1.0x base topping price (standard)
- **Extra**: 1.5x base topping price (50% premium)

### 3. Specialty Pizza Customization Pricing

#### Added Toppings
- **Charge**: Full topping price √ó intensity multiplier
- **Example**: Adding extra cheese (regular) = $2.50 √ó 1.0 = +$2.50

#### Removed Toppings
- **Credit**: 50% of original topping value √ó original intensity multiplier
- **Example**: Removing broccoli (regular) = $2.50 √ó 1.0 √ó 0.5 = -$1.25 credit
- **Rationale**: Partial credit acknowledges ingredient cost savings while accounting for preparation complexity

#### Intensity Modifications
- **Adjustment**: Price difference between new and original intensity levels
- **Examples**:
  - Regular ‚Üí Extra: $2.50 √ó (1.5 - 1.0) = +$1.25
  - Regular ‚Üí Light: $2.50 √ó (0.75 - 1.0) = -$0.63
  - Light ‚Üí Extra: $2.50 √ó (1.5 - 0.75) = +$1.88

### 4. Pricing Safeguards
- **Minimum Total**: Pizza total never goes below $0
- **Accurate Calculations**: All pricing uses exact decimals, rounded only for display

## UI Enhancements

### 1. Real-time Pricing Feedback

#### Topping Cards
- **Original Toppings**: Show "Included" with potential removal credit
- **New Toppings**: Show "+$X.XX" addition cost
- **Removal Credits**: Display "-$X.XX if removed" for original toppings

#### Intensity Selectors
- **Visual Pricing**: Show price impact below each intensity button
- **Color Coding**:
  - Red: Price increases (+$X.XX)
  - Green: Price decreases (-$X.XX)
  - Gray: No change
