# Development Environment Issues - Lesson Learned

## Issue Summary (September 8, 2025)
During Docker containerization attempts, the local development environment was temporarily broken due to configuration conflicts.

## What Went Wrong

### Root Causes:
1. **Modified working local configs**: Changed `next.config.js` for Docker builds instead of creating separate configs
2. **Removed `tsconfig.json`**: This broke TypeScript path aliases (`@/` imports), causing build failures
3. **Environment variable override**: PowerShell session got `DATABASE_URL` set to wrong port (5433 instead of 5432)
4. **Database connection mismatch**: App tried connecting to port 5433 (empty/different data) instead of 5432 (working data)

### Symptoms:
- Build failures with "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/contexts/UserContext'"
- Database connection errors: "Can't reach database server at `localhost:5433`"
- Missing data in local development
- TypeScript compilation errors

## Resolution Steps

1. **Restored `tsconfig.json`** with proper path aliases:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Fixed environment variable**:
```bash
# Wrong (set during Docker attempts)
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://auy1jll66:_Zx-nake_6172@localhost:5433/pizzax"

# Correct (local development)
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://auy1jll66:_Zx-nake_6172@localhost:5432/pizzax"
```

3. **Verified data integrity**: Data was never lost, just inaccessible due to port mismatch

## Prevention Guidelines for Future Docker Work

### ✅ DO:
- Create separate Docker-specific config files (`docker-next.config.js`, `.env.docker`)
- Use Docker-specific environment files
- Backup existing configs before modifications
- Test local dev after any changes
- Use different terminal sessions for Docker vs local dev

### ❌ DON'T:
- Modify working local configuration files
- Remove essential config files like `tsconfig.json`
- Override environment variables in the main development session
- Mix Docker environment with local development environment

## File Status After Resolution
- ✅ `tsconfig.json`: Restored with proper TypeScript configuration
- ✅ `.env.local`: Contains correct local database connection (port 5432)
- ✅ Local database: All data intact on port 5432
- ✅ Build process: Working correctly with path aliases resolved

## Next Steps for Docker Implementation
- Create separate `Dockerfile.production` and `docker-compose.production.yml`
- Use dedicated Docker environment configuration
- Keep local development environment completely isolated
- Test containerization in separate terminal/environment
